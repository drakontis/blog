First of all, i would like to introduce myself.
My name is Panagiotis Drakontis, i am a software engineer and i love writing code in Ruby using the web framework Ruby On Rails.
My first RoR project was an application for my thesis that was managing the reservations of a hotel. It was written in Rails v2.3. (Yes, it was a long time ago)
An the present time i am involved in two big projects that are being developed in Ruby On Rails.

I also love writing tests. I believe that a good test suite is the heart of the application.

In my spare time i love to brew my own beer. It is an activity that i have started two year ago.
During the last 2 years i have been learning to many things about the beer. Firstly i was excited about the strong hop aroma of the IPA's but lately i admire the complexity of the good malty Belgian and English beers. I will write some posts here in my blog about homebrewing, because the people around me saddenly are getting bored when i'm talking about it. :)
