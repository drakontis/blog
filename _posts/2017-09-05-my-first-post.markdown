First of all, I would like to introduce myself.
My name is Panagiotis Drakontis, I am a software engineer and I love writing code in Ruby using the web framework Ruby On Rails.
My first RoR project was an application for my thesis that was managing the reservations of a hotel. It was written in Rails v2.3. (yes, it was a long time ago).
At the present time I am involved in two big projects that are being developed in Ruby On Rails.
I also love writing tests. I believe that a good test suite is the heart of the application.

In my spare time I love to brew my own beer. It is an activity that i started two years ago.
In these 2 years i have been learning many things about beer. Firstly i was excited about the strong hop aroma of the IPA's but lately I am drawn to the complexity of good malty Belgian and English beers. Besides programming posts, there will be some about homebrewing, because the people around me suddenly are getting bored when i'm talking about it. :)
